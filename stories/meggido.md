"College is just a big party". I will never forgive Hollywood movies for lying to me. For me, it was more like [the battle of Megiddo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZcgkT_zAIA); between my previous conception of school (having good grades will help you land a good job) and what the world is showing me about the tech industry.

Like Thutmose III, I chose the narrow route, in fact, my route is maybe narrower than the Pharaoh's.

May 2018, I just started my first year in college majoring in Information Technology. I was pretty curious about what I will learn. After studying Maths and Physics in High school, I had never been exposed to programming; so my dream was to be a hacker, you know... like in the movies with a hoodie, a black terminal with green characters and all (once again screw you Hollywood!). My first class was called **Introduction to ICT**; super boring, we learned about parts of a computer, then MS Office where I spent days going to school to learn how to make wordarts with Microsoft Word, bruh! I learned these in primary.

So I passed **Introduction to ICT** with 98% (Mrs. Jennifer, I haven't forgot my 2marks we need to talk about it.). At this level, I was super confident, making plans to buy my hacker hoodie. Then I hit a rock; my next class was called **Programming in C Language**. The first day, we had to open a weird software called Dev C++ the lecturer called it a Compiler. We wrote the famous "Hello world", I had exactly the same reaction as the cat in the image above... Later on, I approached my lecturer, then he told me about HTML and CSS; so I decided to make a website, I learned HTML and CSS from Youtube, made a crapy website; it took me like a month but still, it was ugly as f but I liked it.

I wanted more of that sorcery, so went back to my C Programming lecture, showed him and he said "Nice, now you can give it more dynamism with PHP". I googled PHP,, the syntax was ugly as f (no offense guys), I just had enough of tags and didn't know about Laravel or cool PHP frameworks back then. One of my cousins was studying mechatronics back then and he told me about Python so I dived into Python, learned Django first, then Flask. Meanwhile, my interest in school was highly decreasing but I was still attending and enjoying some classes. Then in December 2018, I joined an Internship-like program in a company called [DMM.HeHe](https://about.hehe.rw/) where I learned even more about the web. We mainly worked on frontend technologies and used a CMS to fetch data. I learned how to work in a team, how to make a website from a given mockup, how to handle responsiveness, talk with clients, lead teams, testing, etc. That's when I understood that school was f\*cking with me, at least my school cause I know some other universities with a better curriculum. So I decided to switch to another department: Computer Science; pretty similar to my previous department but there were some additional classes like C++, Cryptography, etc. Meanwhile, I was also teaching myself programming and other stuff. While attending classes, now that I had more knowledge about some of the things taught, I realized that our curriculum was pretty old and the system was kinda weird, the teachers were teaching basic stuff, expecting students to do researches and learn more advanced stuff but at the exam, they were asking about the basic stuff they taught. I realize one thing: They are just trying to provide the paper(degree) for you, you need to get the skills on your own. So I suspended school for six months and focused on self-studying, my internship at DMM.HeHe and some gigs I was getting, I also joined an awesome developers community back then.

While I was enjoying playing with cool technologies, others were studying, that's how I accumulated 12 courses on my waiting list because, after my suspension, I took like 3 additional months before coming back to school. I had to study days and nights for those missed courses, yet my attendance was still questionable (silly me).

Here we are, my colleagues are graduating in 5 months, but I have to wait until next year. My only regret is that I didn't drop out earlier, I would have probably had time to learn even more javascript; that language is so confusing. By the way, I no longer have any interest in continuing, maybe I should just drop out now.
