"College is just a big party". I will never forgive Hollywood movies for lying to me. For me, it was more like [the battle of Megiddo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZcgkT_zAIA); between my previous conception of school (having good grades will help you land a good job) and what the world is showing me about the tech industry.

Like Thutmose III, I chose the narrow route, in fact, my route is maybe narrower than the Pharaoh's.

May 2018, I just started my first year in college majoring in Information Technology. I was pretty curious about what I will learn. After studying Maths and Physics in High school, I had never been exposed to programming; so my dream was to be a hacker, you know... like in the movies with a hoodie, a black terminal with green characters and all (once again screw you Hollywood!). My first class was called **Introduction to ICT**; super boring, we learned about parts of a computer, then MS Office where I spent days going to school to learn how to make wordarts with Microsoft Word, bruh! I learned these in primary.

So I passed **Introduction to ICT** with 98% (Mrs. Jennifer, I haven't forgot my 2marks we need to talk about it.). At this level, I was super confident, making plans to buy my hacker hoodie. Then I hit a rock; my next class was called **Programming in C Language**. The first day, we had to open a weird software called Dev C++ the lecturer called it a Compiler. We wrote the famous "Hello world" program, when my code run I had exactly the same facial expression as the cat on the image above... Later on, I approached my lecturer, and he told me about HTML and CSS, then I decided to build a website. I learned HTML and CSS from Youtube and made a crappy website; it took me like a month but still, it was ugly as f; I liked it though.

I wanted to know more of that sorcery, so I went back to Mr. Katende my C programming lecturer, I showed him the website I built and he told me about the backend now and advised me to learn PHP. I googled PHP; LMAO! biggest joke ever: the syntax was ugly as f (no offense PHP devs), I just had enough of tags and didn't know about PHP frameworks back then. One of my cousins was studying mechatronics and he told me about Python so I dived into it. I learned Django first, then Flask; meanwhile, my interest in school was highly decreasing but I was still attending and enjoying some classes. In December 2018, I joined an Internship-like program in a company called [DMM.HeHe](https://about.hehe.rw/) where I learned even more about the web. We mainly worked on frontend technologies and used a CMS as a backend to fetch data. I learned how to work in a team, how to make a website from a given mockup, how to handle responsiveness, talk with clients, lead teams, etc. I started to understand that school was fucking with me, at least my school, because I know some other universities with better curriculums. So I decided to switch to another department: Computer Science, it was pretty similar to IT except some classes that the IT department didn't have like C++, Cryptography, and others. Meanwhile, I was also teaching myself more stuff. Now that I had more knowledge and information, I realized that our curriculum was pretty old compared to other universities and the system was kinda weird, the teachers were teaching basic stuff, expecting students to do researches and learn more advanced stuff but at the exam, they were asking about the basic stuff they taught. They were just trying to provide the paper (degree) for the students who had to get the skills on their own. So I suspended school for six months, focused on self-studying, my internship at DMM.HeHe and some gigs I was getting at the time, I also joined an awesome developers community back then.

While I was enjoying playing with cool technologies, others were studying, after my suspension was expired, I took three additional months before coming back to school. That's how I accumulated 12 courses on my waiting list and was obliged to attend classes during the days and the evenings, yet my attendance rate kept being low lol! (don't tell my dad).

I have friends from other universities who actually enjoy school and learn a lot, it just didn't work for me, I picked the short straw maybe (actually, no). My colleagues are graduating in 5 months, but I have to wait until next year (do I have to wait thoughüåùÔ∏è?).
My only regret is that I didn't drop out earlier, I would have probably had more time to learn about some advanced Javascript concepts, that programming language can be so confusing sometimes. Maybe I should just drop out now.
