Three months ago, I started a new career journey as a Mobile Engineer at [Deriv](https://deriv.com).

Around November 2019, I started learning Flutter from the biggest library in the world: **The Internet**.

Flutter was... different from what I was used to: There was no freaking CSS!! and I could literally use VS Code but the syntax was not very new to me, I studied Java at school and I was using Javascript for some gigs, so Dart was like some weird hidden child that Java and Javascript had; I guess the kid had to grow a little before the parents publicly reveal their secret. In any case, I got used to Dart pretty quickly and enjoyed OOP again, I was sad there were no other major technologies that use it; there was [AngularDart](https://angulardart.xyz/) too but the thing has a freaking .xyz domain, geez!!

I spent almost two years learning more about Flutter, building stuff, contributing to OSS. The more I knew about it, the more I loved it; I got a job where I was mainly using React and a little Python(Flask) after work, I would go back to building my widgets. One day, I just decided to quit everything else and focus on mobile technologies, I started to go even deeper and deeper until I felt confident enough to apply for jobs; but the local market wasn't really on my side. People are crazy about React Native here damn!!

A bunch of failed applications later, I got an offer from [Deriv](https://deriv.com), that was in July 2021. At that time I refused any non-mobile software engineering job. That was kinda stupid cause I was super broke but I didn't want the two years I spent reading and watching videos about Flutter to be resumed to nothing. Fortunately, I got an offer from a great company from an industry that has been very interesting to me lately.

### What does Deriv Do?

If I was given one dogecoin for every minute I spent responding to this question, I would have built a mansion on Mars by today.

Basically, Deriv is an online trading platform that offers a wide selection of derivatives to trade. In a few words, Deriv offers a set of platforms where you can bet on the market. You can, for example, predict that a certain stock will fall, and if your prediction comes true, you make money.

### What do I do at Deriv?

At Deriv, I am part of the Chart team, with a group of amazing other engineers where we work on the chart that allows the users to visualize the evolution of the market. We also work on a bunch of additional tools that improve the users' trading experience on mobile.

### What do you like the most about Deriv?

The people (sounds pretty clichÃ©, I knowðŸ˜…); The company has people from so many different places around the world, it's just amazing to interact with them. It's pretty interesting how people from the same planet can have really different cultures.

At the beginning of this year, I decided to focus on mobile technologies, and I don't regret it. This new journey just excites me even more. So far, I've learned so much from my colleagues, and I am pretty optimistic about what is awaiting me here.
